        involve:"An inspection will reveal potential hazards within the tested installation, check for earth and bonding (or the lack of it), as well as identify any defective work whilst checking all the fixed wiring. This includes testing RCDs to make sure they trip under fault conditions and checking fuse and circuit breaker ratings. Our report also lists non-compliant wiring or fittings.",
